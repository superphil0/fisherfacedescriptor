Dear Philipp,

thanks for your application. Your profile is interesting and we consider your candidature for an internship at VisionLabs. Before making the final decision we usually give candidates a testing exercise to check their skills in programming and computer vision. The exercise below is on gender recognition. Please send us your results once you have them and do not hesitate to ask questions if something is unclear.

We hope to see you at VisionLabs

Best regards
Ivan

Exercise: Gender classification in the Adience benchmark

The goal of this exercise is to train and test a male/female classifier for a given set of face images. You should use images from the recent Adience benchmark http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html#agegender To enable comparison to other methods, the Adience training and testing setup should be used, see the following recent papers reporting results on the Adience benchmark:
[1] http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/EidingerEnbarHassner_tifs.pdf
[2] http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/CNN_AgeGenderEstimation.pdf

To obtain face descriptors you should use pre-trained Fisher Vector Faces Descriptors which implementation is available from VGG http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/face_desc/ Use descriptors trained on unaligned faces, corresponding to the point 2 in the "Data Packages" section in this Readme file https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/face_desc/src/README.txt Although face alignment should give better results, we choose unaligned setup for simplicity.

Once you compute face descriptors for all faces, you should train and test a gender classifier using linear SVM applied to the training and test splits of the Adience benchmark. A proper cross-validation of the C parameter of SVM should be done. Your setup should enable comparison of results with the Table 2. in ref [2] above. Please report classification results for different training/test splits as well as the average and the standard deviation.

Summarize your method and results in a short report including description of the main steps of the approach, the experimental setup, quantitative results as well as qualitative results illustrating hard and easy example faces according to your classifier. Please also send us your code.

Note: Given the descriptor implementation above, we recommend to use Matlab and vl_feat for this exercise. vl_feat includes linear SVM solver.
